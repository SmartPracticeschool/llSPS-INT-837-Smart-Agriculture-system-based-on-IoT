1)INTRODUCTION:-
 1.1) OVERVIEW:- 
                         - In this "SMART AGRICULTURE" project, we have created a UI based on iot using nodered, IBM cloud services and ibm iot sensor.we have connected the iot sensor virtually to IBM cloud and UI.

1.2) Purpose:-
                         -This project focuses on agriculture, and this enables the farmers to monitor the field parameters and control the motors for irrigation from anywhere.
                        - This technology would ultimately improve the yield  and limit the water usage to a greater exrtend, as farmers can consider the field paramters such as moisture, temp and humidty and climate parameters from open weather api before irrigation.
